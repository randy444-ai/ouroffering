    <p>“Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.”</p>
    <footer>— Rumi, 13th-century Persian mystic and poet</footer>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Your nature and the integral nature of the universe are one and the same: indescribable, but eternally present. Simply open yourself to this.”</p>
    <footer>— Lao Tzu</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We are beings born to consciously experience the indescribable, eternally present and ever unfolding ecstatic universe. Our small thoughts and subsequent actions reduce our ability to experience what Rumi and Lao Tzu understood to be our true nature. We need to lean into the mystery of life and allow ourselves to be open to and accepting of our true non-dual nature.</p>

  <p>As we allow ourselves to experience life from beyond the confines of our small thoughts and actions, we effortlessly allow ourselves to understand that our life and all life is truly an expression of non-dual, indescribable, eternally present Consciousness.</p>

  <p>The physical evolution of humans has been successfully achieved. We are prepared to function within the world of objects. We have the ability to make ourselves comfortable. We have developed agricultural systems that produce huge volumes of food. We have medical knowledge that can cure a multitude of injuries and diseases. We have built machines that accomplish mechanical functions that offer humans more free time. Despite our innovative technologies, we rarely find ourselves physically healthy, emotionally balanced, or consistently at ease.</p>

  <p>We must recognize that there will never be enough objects, enough things to satisfy us. Our needs—our real needs—are nonmaterial. In order to experience true physical and emotional health and to truly feel fulfilled, we need to recognize our true identity. We are expressions of a non-dual Consciousness. This ‘Consciousness’, by nature, is, in its non-judgmental eternality, completely satisfied.</p>

  <p>We need to turn our attention inward. We need to understand that our unquestioned beliefs and our small ways of thinking about life become our experiences. Our small thoughts unnecessarily reduce our experiences. Rumi prescribed that we “stop acting so small.”</p>

  <p>Understanding who we really are is the ask. Our very being, the Consciousness that we truly are, is asking us to become awake to and aware of our true identity. Our being is asking us to rediscover; reawaken to our true Self.</p>

  <p>An appropriate response to this ask is imperative to the well-being of the human species and perhaps all species that inhabit the earth. Any delay in the expansion of our personal understanding regarding who and what we truly are will result in ever greater environmental, physiological, and psychological dis-ease.</p>

  <p>Discovering our true identity is the new frontier of human exploration. We are inner space explorers set to discover a new universe, a universe of nondual, nondimensional, nonmaterial, timeless, ever-present Consciousness.</p>

  <p>There have been instances in each of our lives when we have experienced ecstatic, open minded Consciousness. Many of these experiences occurred in our childhood, before we became programmed to interact with a world that demands that we make something of ourselves.</p>

  <p>As adults, many of us have temporarily, directly experienced non-duality with the aid of the medicine of teacher plants. These medicine-induced experiences serve to temporarily expose the deeper reality of our innate being-ness. But for most, the effects of the medicine diminish and we find ourselves back in our everyday material body with our everyday material problems created by our belief that we need to make something of ourselves.</p>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Truly I say to you, unless you change and become as children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
    <footer>— Jesus</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Jesus was telling us that as children we possess openness. As children, we nonjudgmentally experience our universe. Unfortunately, as we become educated, we learn to judge our experiences. We lose our innocence and forget that we are the universe in ecstatic motion. We forget the effortless joy and wonder that we experienced as children.</p>

  <p>We need to recognize that the dissatisfaction and discomfort we feel within our everyday lives really is the Soul we each possess calling us to resume our non-judgmental journey of Self-discovery.</p>
