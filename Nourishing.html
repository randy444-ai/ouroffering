    <h2>Nourishing Our Soul</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Rediscovering our true nature through openness, remembrance, and inner exploration</p>
  </header>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.”</p>
    <footer>— Rumi, 13th-century Persian mystic and poet</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Your nature and the integral nature of the universe are one and the same: indescribable, but eternally present. Simply open yourself to this.”</p>
    <footer>— Lao Tzu</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We are beings born to consciously experience the indescribable, eternally present and ever unfolding ecstatic universe. Our small thoughts and subsequent actions reduce our ability to experience what Rumi and Lao Tzu understood to be our true nature. We need to lean into the mystery of life and allow ourselves to be open to and accepting of our true non-dual nature.</p>

  <p>As we allow ourselves to experience life from beyond the confines of our small thoughts and actions, we effortlessly allow ourselves to understand that our life and all life is truly an expression of non-dual, indescribable, eternally present Consciousness.</p>

  <p>The physical evolution of humans has been successfully achieved. We are prepared to function within the world of objects. We have the ability to make ourselves comfortable. We have developed agricultural systems that produce huge volumes of food. We have medical knowledge that can cure a multitude of injuries and diseases. We have built machines that accomplish mechanical functions that offer humans more free time. Despite our innovative technologies, we rarely find ourselves physically healthy, emotionally balanced, or consistently at ease.</p>

  <p>We must recognize that there will never be enough objects, enough things to satisfy us. Our needs—our real needs—are nonmaterial. In order to experience true physical and emotional health and to truly feel fulfilled, we need to recognize our true identity. We are expressions of a non-dual Consciousness. This ‘Consciousness’, by nature, is, in its non-judgmental eternality, completely satisfied.</p>

  <p>We need to turn our attention inward. We need to understand that our unquestioned beliefs and our small ways of thinking about life become our experiences. Our small thoughts unnecessarily reduce our experiences. Rumi prescribed that we “stop acting so small.”</p>

  <p>Understanding who we really are is the ask. Our very being, the Consciousness that we truly are, is asking us to become awake to and aware of our true identity. Our being is asking us to rediscover; reawaken to our true Self.</p>

  <p>An appropriate response to this ask is imperative to the well-being of the human species and perhaps all species that inhabit the earth. Any delay in the expansion of our personal understanding regarding who and what we truly are will result in ever greater environmental, physiological, and psychological dis-ease.</p>

  <p>Discovering our true identity is the new frontier of human exploration. We are inner space explorers set to discover a new universe, a universe of nondual, nondimensional, nonmaterial, timeless, ever-present Consciousness.</p>

  <p>There have been instances in each of our lives when we have experienced ecstatic, open minded Consciousness. Many of these experiences occurred in our childhood, before we became programmed to interact with a world that demands that we make something of ourselves.</p>

  <p>As adults, many of us have temporarily, directly experienced non-duality with the aid of the medicine of teacher plants. These medicine-induced experiences serve to temporarily expose the deeper reality of our innate being-ness. But for most, the effects of the medicine diminish and we find ourselves back in our everyday material body with our everyday material problems created by our belief that we need to make something of ourselves.</p>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Truly I say to you, unless you change and become as children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
    <footer>— Jesus</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Jesus was telling us that as children we possess openness. As children, we nonjudgmentally experience our universe. Unfortunately, as we become educated, we learn to judge our experiences. We lose our innocence and forget that we are the universe in ecstatic motion. We forget the effortless joy and wonder that we experienced as children.</p>

  <p>We need to recognize that the dissatisfaction and discomfort we feel within our everyday lives really is the Soul we each possess calling us to resume our non-judgmental journey of Self-discovery.</p>

    <h2>SOUL</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Reconnecting with the essence of our being beyond the illusion of material separation</p>
  </header>

  <p>Our life experiences have become exceedingly externalized and materialized. Even God has become externalized and materialized, seen as some “thing” outside and separate from us. We are mesmerized by the illusion of duality. Our misdirected dualistic focus places inappropriate value on material gain. Our ambition to make ourselves materially full is taking us in the wrong direction. Our focus on the inappropriate value of a material world has caused us to lose contact with our Soul. This disconnect causes us to feel an emptiness and fear; and this emptiness and fear cannot be mitigated with more stuff. Our empty feelings, fear, and anxiety can only be cured by allowing ourselves to reestablish our deeply personal connection with our Soul.</p>

  <p>The Soul carries the essence of our ultimate, non-dual beingness. It holds the potential to reveal this essence—not as an abstract ideal, but as a living reality available in every moment.</p>

  <p>It is the essence of who and what we truly are. Resting quietly in the deepest folds of personal experience, the Soul is not something to be attained, but something to be remembered.</p>

  <p>It is the light that shines eternally within the layered architecture of the personal mind, quietly illuminating all thought and perception from behind the scenes. In its quiet radiance, we are continuously offered the opportunity to recognize what has always been present.</p>

  <p>We must understand that we are positioned on the threshold of an evolutionary change; a change that requires shifting our attention from things outside ourselves to the thoughts that exist within us. Our ability to experience the ever-present joy and wonder our lives offer depends on our ability to shift our focus and turn our attention toward finding our way home to the nonjudgmental true Self we knew as children. Our Soul knows the way.</p>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“People nowadays speak of the body and the mind, but they only know the illusory body and mind, and do not know the true body and mind. As they leave the true to follow the false, it is no wonder that even before their number of years is exhausted, their bodies and minds are worn out. They have the forms of living human beings, but their souls have entered the lair of demons.”</p>
    <footer>— Liu Yiming (1734–1821), <em>Cultivating the Tao</em></footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When we spend our life energy, the energy of our spirit, chasing the mirage of a materially based experience, our Soul suffers. Our Soul enters into the lair of demons where the quest for more “stuff” drains us of our life force and leaves our Soul overshadowed by our small thoughts.</p>

  <p>Rumi nourished his Soul by being an aware participant, consciously engaging with the nondual, nondimensional, and nonmaterial indescribable conscious universe in ecstatic motion. He pointed at his indescribable conscious experiences in his poetry.</p>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there.<br>When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about.”</p>
    <footer>— Rumi</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Imagine a life experience that is so full there are no words. The potential to experience this kind of fullness exists within each of us because we are, by our very nature, this fullness. Soul possesses the wisdom that can allow us to understand the intrinsic value of the nonmaterial universe. Learning to listen to the wisdom of Soul will allow us to open our lives to the ever-present experiences of joy and wonder, experiences that, in this very moment, exist just beyond the small world of our small thoughts.</p>

  <p>We must understand that our body and our mind are energetic expressions of eternal Consciousness. We must understand that we possess an innate ability to consciously experience our life and cause our experiences to nourish the Soul. Without our conscious attention, the energy necessary to nourish our Soul will be consumed by the illusionary belief that we are separate from Consciousness. This false belief is the cause of our needless struggle with the mesmerizing material world.</p>

    <h2>Mind, Body, Spirit</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Three expressions of eternal Consciousness—woven into the fabric of our being</p>
  </header>

  <section id="mind">
    <h3>Mind</h3>
    <p>Mind is the conscious activity of eternal Consciousness. The activity of Mind gives form to the indescribable, nondual universe that we inhabit. And we humans, as expressions of this eternal Consciousness, have the privilege of knowingly engaging with the very activity that we are. We are the conscious activity of Consciousness. We therefore have the privilege and the potential of experiencing ourselves as this Consciousness.</p>

    <p>True happiness and true joy are not brain functions; they are non-dual expressions of Consciousness. Eternal Consciousness expresses itself in the natural forms that pervade the universe. All that exists flows endlessly within this vastly eternal conscious Mind.</p>

    <p>We must understand that this conscious Mind does not think—it expresses. To think implies the use of memories, opinions, beliefs or agendas. Conscious Mind is open minded; it has no memories, opinions, beliefs or agendas, it simply, without beginning and without end, expresses.</p>

    <p>Understanding that we are expressions of this open minded, timeless Consciousness allows us to experience states that transcend the realm of our opinionated small self. We are never separate from this conscious eternal Mind. We are integral expressions of this eternal Mind.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="body">
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>Our bodies are formed expressions of Mind as it actively expresses its vast wondrous non-judgmental beingness. Our bodies are never separate from the non-dual beingness of Mind. The natural wonders of the world and of the universe that we have the privilege to consciously experience is also the outward appearing and yet never separate expression of Mind.</p>

    <p>Our bodies offer us the opportunity to gracefully and with gratitude, consciously experience the wondrous sensations of this indescribable universe as it actively expresses. Not only do our bodies allow us to experience the energetic flow of the universe, they also allow us to consciously recognize that we ARE the flow. In order to experience the wonders of the universe we must actively, with attention, allow ourselves to consciously participate, without judgment, in this ecstatic endless flow of Consciousness.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="spirit">
    <h3>Spirit</h3>
    <blockquote class="epigraph">
      <p>“You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.”</p>
      <footer>— Rumi</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Spirit is the conscious energetic field of eternal Mind. Spirit is an ocean of unformed energy. Everything that exists, exists within this energetic field. Our bodies are of this energy and exist within this energy. We simply do not recognize and acknowledge that we are this ever-present infinite energy. We do not recognize that we are “the entire ocean in a drop”.</p>

    <p>With an understanding of and a concentrated focus on our true nature, we can use our true Mind, our true Body, and the energy of Spirit to move beyond the limited experiences caused by our small thoughts and actions.</p>

    <p>We can let go of the small thoughts and actions of our small self. We can recognize that we are the entire ocean in a drop. Every time we give ourselves the gift of conscious recognition that we are the entire ocean in a drop, we nourish our Soul. Every time we nourish our Soul; we allow ourselves to effortlessly see more deeply into the mystery of our beingness. Every time we remember to let go of our small thoughts, we free our Soul from the self-imposed “lair of demons”. “Simply open yourself to this”. Simply remember this.</p>

    <h2>Magnetic Center</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Transforming experience into nourishment through conscious recognition</p>
  </header>

  <p>Each of us possess a magnetic center. Our individual magnetic center attracts our experiences. Our experiences are our medicine. Our experiences can serve to expose the patterns of our thoughts. Once exposed, we have the opportunity to change the way we think about our life experiences, correct them, and alter them in ways that reflect our recognition of who and what we really are. We are Consciousness. Our conscious recognition of this reality transforms the energy of our experience into food for our Soul.</p>

  <p>If we do not make efforts to change the way we think about our experiences, our magnetic center will continue to attract similar experiences. This is the way the medicine of life works. We have the choice of living and reliving the same energy-depleting experiences day in and day out. Or, we can, with awareness, take the medicine of life and allow ourselves to see ourselves acting small. We can then use true Mind, Body, and Spirit to transform our experiences. These experiences change our magnetic center, allowing it to attract new expanding universal experiences, experiences that are the portal to real freedom.</p>
