    <h2>Nourishing Our Soul</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Rediscovering our true nature through openness, remembrance, and inner exploration</p>
  </header>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.”</p>
    <footer>— Rumi, 13th-century Persian mystic and poet</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Your nature and the integral nature of the universe are one and the same: indescribable, but eternally present. Simply open yourself to this.”</p>
    <footer>— Lao Tzu</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We are beings born to consciously experience the indescribable, eternally present and ever unfolding ecstatic universe. Our small thoughts and subsequent actions reduce our ability to experience what Rumi and Lao Tzu understood to be our true nature. We need to lean into the mystery of life and allow ourselves to be open to and accepting of our true non-dual nature.</p>

  <p>As we allow ourselves to experience life from beyond the confines of our small thoughts and actions, we effortlessly allow ourselves to understand that our life and all life is truly an expression of non-dual, indescribable, eternally present Consciousness.</p>

  <p>The physical evolution of humans has been successfully achieved. We are prepared to function within the world of objects. We have the ability to make ourselves comfortable. We have developed agricultural systems that produce huge volumes of food. We have medical knowledge that can cure a multitude of injuries and diseases. We have built machines that accomplish mechanical functions that offer humans more free time. Despite our innovative technologies, we rarely find ourselves physically healthy, emotionally balanced, or consistently at ease.</p>

  <p>We must recognize that there will never be enough objects, enough things to satisfy us. Our needs—our real needs—are nonmaterial. In order to experience true physical and emotional health and to truly feel fulfilled, we need to recognize our true identity. We are expressions of a non-dual Consciousness. This ‘Consciousness’, by nature, is, in its non-judgmental eternality, completely satisfied.</p>

  <p>We need to turn our attention inward. We need to understand that our unquestioned beliefs and our small ways of thinking about life become our experiences. Our small thoughts unnecessarily reduce our experiences. Rumi prescribed that we “stop acting so small.”</p>

  <p>Understanding who we really are is the ask. Our very being, the Consciousness that we truly are, is asking us to become awake to and aware of our true identity. Our being is asking us to rediscover; reawaken to our true Self.</p>

  <p>An appropriate response to this ask is imperative to the well-being of the human species and perhaps all species that inhabit the earth. Any delay in the expansion of our personal understanding regarding who and what we truly are will result in ever greater environmental, physiological, and psychological dis-ease.</p>

  <p>Discovering our true identity is the new frontier of human exploration. We are inner space explorers set to discover a new universe, a universe of nondual, nondimensional, nonmaterial, timeless, ever-present Consciousness.</p>

  <p>There have been instances in each of our lives when we have experienced ecstatic, open minded Consciousness. Many of these experiences occurred in our childhood, before we became programmed to interact with a world that demands that we make something of ourselves.</p>

  <p>As adults, many of us have temporarily, directly experienced non-duality with the aid of the medicine of teacher plants. These medicine-induced experiences serve to temporarily expose the deeper reality of our innate being-ness. But for most, the effects of the medicine diminish and we find ourselves back in our everyday material body with our everyday material problems created by our belief that we need to make something of ourselves.</p>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Truly I say to you, unless you change and become as children, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
    <footer>— Jesus</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Jesus was telling us that as children we possess openness. As children, we nonjudgmentally experience our universe. Unfortunately, as we become educated, we learn to judge our experiences. We lose our innocence and forget that we are the universe in ecstatic motion. We forget the effortless joy and wonder that we experienced as children.</p>

  <p>We need to recognize that the dissatisfaction and discomfort we feel within our everyday lives really is the Soul we each possess calling us to resume our non-judgmental journey of Self-discovery.</p>

    <h2>SOUL</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Reconnecting with the essence of our being beyond the illusion of material separation</p>
  </header>

  <p>Our life experiences have become exceedingly externalized and materialized. Even God has become externalized and materialized, seen as some “thing” outside and separate from us. We are mesmerized by the illusion of duality. Our misdirected dualistic focus places inappropriate value on material gain. Our ambition to make ourselves materially full is taking us in the wrong direction. Our focus on the inappropriate value of a material world has caused us to lose contact with our Soul. This disconnect causes us to feel an emptiness and fear; and this emptiness and fear cannot be mitigated with more stuff. Our empty feelings, fear, and anxiety can only be cured by allowing ourselves to reestablish our deeply personal connection with our Soul.</p>

  <p>The Soul carries the essence of our ultimate, non-dual beingness. It holds the potential to reveal this essence—not as an abstract ideal, but as a living reality available in every moment.</p>

  <p>It is the essence of who and what we truly are. Resting quietly in the deepest folds of personal experience, the Soul is not something to be attained, but something to be remembered.</p>

  <p>It is the light that shines eternally within the layered architecture of the personal mind, quietly illuminating all thought and perception from behind the scenes. In its quiet radiance, we are continuously offered the opportunity to recognize what has always been present.</p>

  <p>We must understand that we are positioned on the threshold of an evolutionary change; a change that requires shifting our attention from things outside ourselves to the thoughts that exist within us. Our ability to experience the ever-present joy and wonder our lives offer depends on our ability to shift our focus and turn our attention toward finding our way home to the nonjudgmental true Self we knew as children. Our Soul knows the way.</p>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“People nowadays speak of the body and the mind, but they only know the illusory body and mind, and do not know the true body and mind. As they leave the true to follow the false, it is no wonder that even before their number of years is exhausted, their bodies and minds are worn out. They have the forms of living human beings, but their souls have entered the lair of demons.”</p>
    <footer>— Liu Yiming (1734–1821), <em>Cultivating the Tao</em></footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When we spend our life energy, the energy of our spirit, chasing the mirage of a materially based experience, our Soul suffers. Our Soul enters into the lair of demons where the quest for more “stuff” drains us of our life force and leaves our Soul overshadowed by our small thoughts.</p>

  <p>Rumi nourished his Soul by being an aware participant, consciously engaging with the nondual, nondimensional, and nonmaterial indescribable conscious universe in ecstatic motion. He pointed at his indescribable conscious experiences in his poetry.</p>

  <blockquote class="epigraph">
    <p>“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there.<br>When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about.”</p>
    <footer>— Rumi</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Imagine a life experience that is so full there are no words. The potential to experience this kind of fullness exists within each of us because we are, by our very nature, this fullness. Soul possesses the wisdom that can allow us to understand the intrinsic value of the nonmaterial universe. Learning to listen to the wisdom of Soul will allow us to open our lives to the ever-present experiences of joy and wonder, experiences that, in this very moment, exist just beyond the small world of our small thoughts.</p>

  <p>We must understand that our body and our mind are energetic expressions of eternal Consciousness. We must understand that we possess an innate ability to consciously experience our life and cause our experiences to nourish the Soul. Without our conscious attention, the energy necessary to nourish our Soul will be consumed by the illusionary belief that we are separate from Consciousness. This false belief is the cause of our needless struggle with the mesmerizing material world.</p>

    <h2>Mind, Body, Spirit</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Three expressions of eternal Consciousness—woven into the fabric of our being</p>
  </header>

  <section id="mind">
    <h3>Mind</h3>
    <p>Mind is the conscious activity of eternal Consciousness. The activity of Mind gives form to the indescribable, nondual universe that we inhabit. And we humans, as expressions of this eternal Consciousness, have the privilege of knowingly engaging with the very activity that we are. We are the conscious activity of Consciousness. We therefore have the privilege and the potential of experiencing ourselves as this Consciousness.</p>

    <p>True happiness and true joy are not brain functions; they are non-dual expressions of Consciousness. Eternal Consciousness expresses itself in the natural forms that pervade the universe. All that exists flows endlessly within this vastly eternal conscious Mind.</p>

    <p>We must understand that this conscious Mind does not think—it expresses. To think implies the use of memories, opinions, beliefs or agendas. Conscious Mind is open minded; it has no memories, opinions, beliefs or agendas, it simply, without beginning and without end, expresses.</p>

    <p>Understanding that we are expressions of this open minded, timeless Consciousness allows us to experience states that transcend the realm of our opinionated small self. We are never separate from this conscious eternal Mind. We are integral expressions of this eternal Mind.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="body">
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>Our bodies are formed expressions of Mind as it actively expresses its vast wondrous non-judgmental beingness. Our bodies are never separate from the non-dual beingness of Mind. The natural wonders of the world and of the universe that we have the privilege to consciously experience is also the outward appearing and yet never separate expression of Mind.</p>

    <p>Our bodies offer us the opportunity to gracefully and with gratitude, consciously experience the wondrous sensations of this indescribable universe as it actively expresses. Not only do our bodies allow us to experience the energetic flow of the universe, they also allow us to consciously recognize that we ARE the flow. In order to experience the wonders of the universe we must actively, with attention, allow ourselves to consciously participate, without judgment, in this ecstatic endless flow of Consciousness.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="spirit">
    <h3>Spirit</h3>
    <blockquote class="epigraph">
      <p>“You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.”</p>
      <footer>— Rumi</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Spirit is the conscious energetic field of eternal Mind. Spirit is an ocean of unformed energy. Everything that exists, exists within this energetic field. Our bodies are of this energy and exist within this energy. We simply do not recognize and acknowledge that we are this ever-present infinite energy. We do not recognize that we are “the entire ocean in a drop”.</p>

    <p>With an understanding of and a concentrated focus on our true nature, we can use our true Mind, our true Body, and the energy of Spirit to move beyond the limited experiences caused by our small thoughts and actions.</p>

    <p>We can let go of the small thoughts and actions of our small self. We can recognize that we are the entire ocean in a drop. Every time we give ourselves the gift of conscious recognition that we are the entire ocean in a drop, we nourish our Soul. Every time we nourish our Soul; we allow ourselves to effortlessly see more deeply into the mystery of our beingness. Every time we remember to let go of our small thoughts, we free our Soul from the self-imposed “lair of demons”. “Simply open yourself to this”. Simply remember this.</p>

    <h2>Magnetic Center</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Transforming experience into nourishment through conscious recognition</p>
  </header>

  <p>Each of us possess a magnetic center. Our individual magnetic center attracts our experiences. Our experiences are our medicine. Our experiences can serve to expose the patterns of our thoughts. Once exposed, we have the opportunity to change the way we think about our life experiences, correct them, and alter them in ways that reflect our recognition of who and what we really are. We are Consciousness. Our conscious recognition of this reality transforms the energy of our experience into food for our Soul.</p>

  <p>If we do not make efforts to change the way we think about our experiences, our magnetic center will continue to attract similar experiences. This is the way the medicine of life works. We have the choice of living and reliving the same energy-depleting experiences day in and day out. Or, we can, with awareness, take the medicine of life and allow ourselves to see ourselves acting small. We can then use true Mind, Body, and Spirit to transform our experiences. These experiences change our magnetic center, allowing it to attract new expanding universal experiences, experiences that are the portal to real freedom.</p>

    <h2>A Return to Essence</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Reclaiming the original expression of Consciousness beneath personality</p>
  </header>

  <p>When we are born into this life, we each possess a unique essence. We are unique essential expressions of Consciousness. Our essence, by its very nature, desires to be expressed. Unfortunately, in our world today we have unconsciously allowed personality to dominate essence. This is an upside-down arrangement that should be corrected.</p>
</article>
  <article id="personality" class="nourishing-entry">
  <header>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Re-educating the mask to serve the essence</p>
  </header>

  <p>Personality, unlike our conscious essence, does not come with us into this world. The family we are born into and the region of earth that we initially inhabit provide the major building blocks of our personality. The moment we are born, our personality begins to be instilled in us. The list of personality-shaping influences is long. Our parents may subscribe us to the dogma of an organized religion. Perhaps we are raised in a middle-class Christian neighborhood or perhaps in a materially impoverished third world country. The formal education we receive and the influences of our family and friends all play a part in shaping our unique personalities.</p>

  <p>The problem is, the unconsciously accepted aspects of our personalities begin to eclipse our essence. And there is little effort made by our families, our schools, or our culture to reign in our personalities and introduce us to our essence and our true Mind, Body, and Spirit.</p>

  <p>We unconsciously accept the misperceptions of our society, and these misperceptions become the habituated lenses through which we see our world. We project our opinions and what we think we know onto the energetic field of life, and these projected misperceptions manifest and do not allow for the exhilarating expression of our essence.</p>

  <p>Unless we begin to ask ourselves why we act and feel the way we do about almost everything, our lives will become more and more entrenched in the world of our personality, and with this entrenchment we stray from our essential path and condemn ourselves to the revolving door of our habituated personalities, seldom catching glimpses of our essential being. We unconsciously deny ourselves the opportunity to experience life as it truly is.</p>

  <p>Personality is a necessary component of the life experience; it is the tool that, when used correctly, allows our essence to be expressed. Our personalities need to be re-educated to assist our essence rather than restrict our essence.</p>

  <article id="many-identities" class="nourishing-entry">
  <header>
    <h2>Our Many Identities</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Self-observation as a path to Soul nourishment</p>
  </header>

  <p>G. I. Gurdjieff was an enigmatic, twentieth-century teacher masterful in the Fourth Way tradition. The Fourth Way tradition tells us that our personalities are comprised of many separate identities, and we live our lives experiencing the attitudes of these revolving identities. In any given situation, at any given moment, an identity will unconsciously be allowed to step forward from within the cast of our personality and take center stage. The up-front identity will experience and react to the situation according to its memories, its way of thinking. The small thoughts of the small identity will be projected onto the energetic field and this projection will reflect the thoughts of that identity.</p>

  <p>We fail to recognize that we are comprised of many identities. When we say “I,” we assume ourselves to be one self, when in reality we are many small selves, each possessing its own set of beliefs, ideas, and agendas. In most instances, the identity that we unconsciously allow to come forward and interact with any given situation uses its memory, its habituated way of thinking, to engage with the experience. In most situations it is not qualified to profitably handle or respond to the situation. Habituated, small-thinking identities do not often successfully transform universal energy. They far too often fail to feed the Soul.</p>

  <p>The good news is that when we understand that there are many identities, many small selves contained in our personality, we can begin to watch for and self-observe our identities. Our observations allow us to dissect our personality, examine each identity, and determine the cost-benefit ratio of that identity. We can examine the identity and decide if it is contributing to a real understanding of Mind, Body, and Spirit. If it is not, we can choose to forgive ourselves for misunderstanding and gently restrict unprofitable identities from accessing our energy. We can change our investment strategy.</p>

    <h2>Four Levels of Consciousness</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">A quiet ascent from sleep to persistent awareness</p>
  </header>

  <p>The first step we can take when we set out to make the transformational journey into a new understanding of our universe of non-duality is admit to ourselves that we are functioning at a very low-level of consciousness. The Fourth Way tradition points out that there are four recognizable levels.</p>

  <section id="level-sleep">
    <h3>1. Sleep</h3>
    <p>The first level of consciousness is the level of sleep and occurs when we are actually, physically, sleeping. Within this level we dream. Our dreams may be fantastic journeys through our collective unconsciousness, but they are fleeting images and are gone when we open our eyes. The shadow of the memory of the dream may remain, but our dream experience fades into the second level of consciousness.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="level-waking-sleep">
    <h3>2. Waking Sleep</h3>
    <p>The second level of consciousness is the level of waking sleep. We spend most of our lives in the state of waking sleep where the memories and habits of our many small identities express themselves. The small thoughts and actions of our small identities dominate our experience. We identify ourselves with our small thoughts. In waking sleep, we react to the present moment using judgments born in past experiences; experiences based on our instilled belief that we need to make something of ourselves. We are unaware that Consciousness is always present. It is this lack of awareness that unnecessarily reduces our life experiences to the revolving door of our small identities.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="level-awakening">
    <h3>3. Awakening</h3>
    <p>The third level of consciousness is the level of awakening, a level of recognition. We begin to recognize that we live in a universe unnecessarily reduced to fit our small thinking. This level of awakening allows us to open the door of opportunity and turn our attention inward. We can begin to ask ourselves why we think and act as we do. We can begin to understand that it is the habituated way we think and act that blocks our understanding regarding our inherent non-dual identity as expressions of eternal Consciousness.</p>

    <p>We can momentarily become conscious by simply asking ourselves if we are aware. When we ask ourselves if we are aware, for that brief moment we are aware, and in that brief moment our Soul is nourished. The more we remember to ask ourselves if we are aware, the more nourishment the Soul receives. A nourished Soul counsels us in the expanding art of conscious awareness. Conscious awareness leads us to experiences of the fourth level of consciousness.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="level-persistent-awareness">
    <h3>4. Persistent Awareness</h3>
    <p>The fourth level of consciousness is the level of persistent nonjudgmental conscious awareness. From within the fourth level, life is experienced in the nonjudgmental conscious experience of the moment. We give our attention, our awareness to the moment. In that moment of awareness, we remember that we are and all life is an expression of eternal Consciousness.</p>

    <p>Jesus and Siddhartha became aware of this eternal reality and lived consistently, persistently with the conscious awareness of this reality. Jesus, Siddhartha, Lao Tzu, and all master teachers can be considered examples or archetypes that demonstrate our inherent potential.</p>

  <header>
    <h2>Self-Remembering</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Awakening to the eternal Self through conscious recognition</p>
  </header>

  <p>Self-remembering is a power tool useful in our efforts to awaken to and become conscious of our true Self—the Self that is the potent eternal expression of Consciousness.</p>

  <p>Self-remembering is the act of remembering that we are the ecstatic universe in motion, it is the act of recognizing and opening ourselves to the reality that our nature and the integral nature of the universe are one and the same: indescribable, but eternally present. It is the process of remembering that we are, and all things are, a singular yet multifaceted expression of the indescribable jewel of Consciousness.</p>

  <p>Self-remembering involves remembering that Soul exists within each of us and that it is available to introduce us to our true Self. Self-remembering is the art of remembering that we are at all times, regardless of appearances, our true Self; the true Self that is the expression of eternal Consciousness.</p>

  <p>Whenever we have the presence of Mind, we should take that moment and acknowledge that there is a true Self. We should feel certain, with all our sensual being, that eternal Consciousness is present. Even though we may not fully understand the depth of our true Self and its relationship with eternal Consciousness, the simple act of reflecting on what we are learning about our true Self is penetrating and dissolves our misperceptions regarding who and what we think we are and reveals who and what we truly are. We are eternal Consciousness.</p>

    <h2>Self-Observation</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Watching without judgment, nourishing the Soul through presence</p>
  </header>

  <p>Self-observation is another power tool useful in our efforts to awaken to and open ourselves to our true Self.</p>

  <p>Self-observation is the process of learning to watch ourselves as we go about our day. We can watch our identities and the way they interact with the world. We can name them; get to know them. The identities we most often see are the identities Rumi rightly accused of “acting small.” These small identities are unaware that they live within non-dual eternal Consciousness. They know only the small world of their opinions and memories; opinions and memories that are based on incomplete information regarding the reality of our true being.</p>

  <p>We can, as the observer, quietly and without judgment, watch ourselves and the world around us. We can watch the way our identities respond to the given moment, and we can watch how the world responds to our identities and the attitudes of our identities. We can also watch the identities of all those around us. Nonjudgmental self-observation is a nutrient-dense feast for the Soul.</p>

  <header>
    <h2>Self-Observation / Self-Remembering</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Split attention as a portal to Soul nourishment and timeless awareness</p>
  </header>

  <p>The process of Self-remembering can go hand in hand with self-observation. At the moment we remember to self-observe, there is an opportunity to simultaneously and with split attention Self-remember. We can watch our small self, acting small, and we can remember that our true Self is as vast and eternal as Rumi’s “universe in ecstatic motion”.</p>

  <p>In these moments of split attention, these moments when we are the observed and the observer, time slows and insight into what it means to be the universe in ecstatic motion filters into our awareness. In these moments of split attention, we effortlessly experience true Mind, Body, and Spirit. In these effortless moments of attention, we nourish our Soul and we offer ourselves the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the ultimate reality of the non-dual eternal Consciousness.</p>

  <article id="nonduality" class="nourishing-entry">
  <header>
    <h2>Nonduality</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Recognizing the singular nature of Consciousness beyond separation</p>
  </header>

  <p>Rumi was speaking of nonduality when he said, “Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.” Siddhartha, the master of Buddhist teachings, used the concept of OM to express non-duality. Hinduism uses the concept of Brahman to express the ultimate nondual nature of the universe. Jesus said, “I and the Father are One.” Lao Tzu referred to non-duality as the Tao.</p>

  <p>Erwin Schrödinger, Nobel prize winner in physics, suggested that physics is compatible with the notion that there is a basic non-duality at the heart of the universe. Scientifically recognizing non-duality is an intellectual process, and mere intellectual knowledge of non-duality has limitations. Our greatest joy and greatest freedom is realized when we recognize ourselves and the universe as expressions of non-dual eternal Consciousness.</p>

  <p>The origin of the eternal Consciousness is, by its very nature, unknowable. Some sciences and religions have attempted to explain the unknowable origin of Consciousness using a dualistic framework. Some religions have then given what they think to be the origin of this ‘Consciousness’ the name of God. These dualistic thinking religions and sciences serve to perpetuate the idea that we are separate from God and the universe. Our collective misunderstanding of God and the universe, and our need to logically and materially name and explain the illusions formed in a dualistic framework has created unnecessary suffering, suffering born in the mesmerizing illusion of duality.</p>

  <p>God must be set free from our small, dualistically based misunderstandings. In fact, all things that exist within the universe must be set free from our small, dualistic, materialistic thoughts. When our nondual relationship with the nonjudgmental Consciousness is understood, the peace and ease that are qualities attributed to God will be seen as attributes of our true Self.</p>

  <p>We humans, as functions within this singularity, as functions within this nondual universe, have forgotten we are functions and therefore we mistakenly believe ourselves to be separated from the garden where all needs are met. We fail to recognize that our small thoughts, our dualistically formed judgments have created our small worrisome world. This small dualistic world is a world where we struggle to make something of ourselves.</p>

  <p>We can free ourselves from our self-imposed feelings of needing to make ourselves happy and find fulfillment by simply remembering who and what we truly are. We are expressions of a nondual eternal Consciousness. And as expressions of this nondual Consciousness, we are always in full possession of all we need. We simply need to understand this and recognize the non-dual nature of our true Self.</p>

    <h2>Direct the Flow</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Reclaiming vital energy through conscious redirection and Soul nourishment</p>
  </header>

  <p>Many of our identities act very small. They exist in a state of waking sleep and are unable to understand and embrace the integral relationship they have with Consciousness. In order to experience the innate freedom available to us as expressions of Consciousness, we need to learn to redirect the flow of our vital life energy and use this energy to invest in engaging with our true Mind, Body, and Spirit. This righteous engagement empowers our Soul, and our Soul will assist us in our inward journey, a journey of awakening.</p>

  <p>The Fourth Way tradition tells us that if we hope to awaken from the dream of separation, we need to learn to watch for, or self-observe, actions that guarantee loss of vital energy, energy that could be used to produce the food that nourishes our Soul. These actions are negative emotion, negative expression, internal consideration and morbid introspection. Watching for these emotional actions is a great place to use the power tools of self-observation and Self-remembering to shed light on our wasteful identities. Once we have seen these identities, we can reeducate ourselves and release ourselves from the self-imposed prison of our small and fractured thoughts.</p>

 <article id="negative-emotions" class="nourishing-entry">
  <header>
    <h2>Negative Emotions</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Releasing the energy-consuming illusions of small self through non-judgment</p>
  </header>

  <p>Negative emotions are instilled into our personalities; they are not essential. From very early on we learn to judge our experiences as being either good or bad, right or wrong. What we perceive as being good or bad is usually based on the prejudices we have learned from our social environment. We learn to seek out and hold tightly to what we believe to be good, and in order to possess what we believe to be good; we wage an internal and external emotional battle against what we believe to be bad. We push all that we believe to be bad or wrong into a darkened corner of our lives, and then we unknowingly allow the darkness to consume our life energy. Negative emotions consume our life energy.</p>

  <p>Negative expression is the act of allowing our negative emotions to project themselves into our outward appearing experiences and onto the outward appearing experiences of those around us. Negative emotion and its expression can be as small a matter as making a negative comment regarding the weather or it can be as violent as war and murder.</p>

  <p>Internal consideration is an emotion that occurs when we feel we have been wronged or underappreciated by someone or something. We may feel we are owed a debt. We may even find ourselves suffering because we mistakenly believe we owe a debt to someone or something for the wrongs, for the sins, we believe we have committed.</p>

  <p>If we look closely at our internal considerations, we will see that they are born in and belong to one or several of our misguided identities. Internal consideration will cause us to keep a mental ledger noting all the wrongs we believe we have committed or have been committed against us.</p>

  <p>When we begin to see our small identities and their misunderstanding, we may begin to think badly of ourselves. We may begin to judge ourselves for our mistakes. We begin to suffer for what we perceive to be our failure to be more perfect; to make something of ourselves. We fall victim to morbid introspection. Morbid introspection steals vital life energy. We must, in moments of morbid introspection, practice non-judgment. All is forgiven in the universe of non-dual reality. Morbid introspection will serve only to cause us to find it too painful to continue our inward journey of Self-discovery.</p>

  <p>Many lives are consumed in the infectious and unholy fires of our negative emotions. Entire cultures have been infected. These negative emotions of small self will consume our vital life energy and sentence our Soul to the “lair of demons”.</p>

  <p>Recognizing the energy-consuming, unprofitable expression of our negative emotions is powerful. When we are able to observe, without judgment, our negative emotions we have the opportunity to stop engaging in our negativity. The act of simply reducing our emotional engagement with these negative emotions will conserve energy and nourish the Soul. Soul will respond and guide us to the greater freedom of True Self. We need only practice non-judgment and forgiveness on ourselves and all others.</p>

    <h2>The Inherently Beautiful Golden Flower</h2>
    <p class="entry-subtitle">Awakening the true Self from the nutrient-rich mud of small self</p>
  </header>

  <p>The lotus flower as described in many teachings tells us that the lotus begins its expression within the nutrient-rich mud at the bottom of the pond. Within this nutrient-dense mud, the lotus seed sprouts and establishes its foundation. It lays down its roots. The lotus then senses and grows naturally and effortlessly into the light and air available at the surface of the pond, where it branches out and establishes leaves that naturally and effortlessly absorb the air and light. The lotus then uses the nutrients from the muddy bottom and the air and the light from above to manifest its inherent and beautiful flower.</p>

  <p>The flower of the lotus is always, ALWAYS, inherently present within the seed. Its manifestation depends only on the lotus’ natural ability to make use of the food sources available within its environment.</p>

  <p>People are no different from the lotus. Each of us possess, buried in the nutrient-dense mud of our small-self world, the seed of our true Self. And like all seeds, the true Self seed holds within itself the inherently beautiful golden flower of our true Self. The only thing a person needs to do in order to allow for true Self to germinate, grow, and flower is find a way of creating the crack that allows a sliver of conscious light to penetrate into the shadowy world of the small self.</p>

  <p>Our Soul has the power to crack the hard shell of our small self. We need only make small directional non dimensional changes in our way of thinking. These small non dimensional directional changes transform everyday experiences into nourishing food for the Soul.</p>
