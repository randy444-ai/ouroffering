    <!-- Non-dual -->

    <section id="non-dual" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Non-dual</h2>
      <p>
  “Non-dual” points to the indivisible nature of reality — awareness itself,
  where subject and object are not-two. Many wisdom traditions speak of this
  reality: Rumi said, “Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic
  motion.” Siddhartha pointed through OM, Hinduism through Brahman, Jesus
  through “I and the Father are One,” and Lao Tzu through the Tao.
</p>

      <p>
  Modern science also leans toward this recognition. Erwin Schrödinger,
  Nobel Prize–winning physicist, suggested that physics is compatible with
  a basic non-duality at the heart of the universe.
</p>

     <p>
  Our greatest joy and freedom is realized when we recognize ourselves and the
  universe to be expressions of non-dual Consciousness. The origin of this
  Consciousness is unknowable, and attempts to name it too often reinforce the illusion of
  separation, leading to unnecessary suffering.
</p>

      <p>
  God, the universe, and even our own sense of self must be set free from
  limiting concepts. When our Oneness with the non-dual heart of reality is
  understood, the qualities we have attributed only to God — grace, peace,
  ease, satisfaction, and love — are recognized as attributes of our shared
  Being.

    <!-- Illusion -->
<section id="illusion" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Illusion</h2>

  <p>
    An illusion is a misunderstanding or misperception — not something unreal,
    but something taken to be other than it is. A familiar example is the mirage
    of water in the desert or on a highway. Without understanding, the mirage
    is never seen for what it is: a misperception.
  </p>

  <p>
    Life, when understood only through habitual perception, thought, and memory,
    can appear in a similar way — as a series of experiences that never quite
    deliver the substance or satisfaction we seek.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seeing through illusion does not end experience. The world continues to
    appear, but without the misinterpretation that something essential is missing.
    What remains is a sense of fullness already present.
  </p>

  <p>
    Illusion dissolves through recognition rather than effort. When the limits
    of perception and belief are seen, life is experienced more simply,
    directly, and authentically.

   <!-- Beings -->
<section id="beings" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Beings</h2>

  <p>
    In non-dual language, the word <em>beings</em> does not refer to many separate
    entities, but to the appearance of multiplicity within a single, indivisible
    reality. What seem to be separate beings are expressions of one Being.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each of us is not a being apart from Beingness, but an expression of it.
    The same essence appears as all forms, without being divided by them.
  </p>
</section>


    <!-- Experience -->
<section id="experience" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <p>
    <em>verb</em> — to undergo or be present with what appears.
  </p>

  <p>
    In non-dual understanding, experience arises within Conscious Awareness.
    Awareness itself does not stand apart from experience, nor is it affected
    by what appears. Experience is the play of sensations, thoughts, feelings,
    and perceptions appearing in Awareness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Human beings are not separate experiencers, but expressions through which
    experience occurs. The body and mind provide the conditions for tasting,
    touching, hearing, smelling, feeling, and thinking — all of which arise
    within Conscious Awareness.
  </p>

  <p>
    When experience is taken to define who we are, confusion and suffering
    arise. When experience is seen as appearance rather than identity,
    its fullness can be appreciated without division.
  </p>

  <p>
    Awareness remains unchanged by experience. It does not forget itself,
    and it does not suffer.

   <!-- Stop Acting So Small -->
<section id="stop-acting-so-small" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Stop Acting So Small</h2>

  <p>
    A pointing phrase (from Rumi) that invites us to notice when we are
    identifying with a contracted, separate sense of self — the “small self.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Small” does not mean unworthy. It simply names the habit of taking
    thoughts, roles, fears, and personal history to be what we are.
  </p>

  <p>
    To “stop acting so small” is to relax that identification and open to what
    is already present: the True Self — Conscious Awareness itself — in which
    all experience appears.

    <!-- True Self -->
    <section id="true-self" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>True Self</h2>
      <p>The True Self is what we are before identity, roles, or conditioning create the illusion of separation. It is our unchanging essence — awareness itself — untouched by the stories we tell about who and what we think we are.</p>
      <p>To discover the True Self is not to become something new, but to recognize who and what we have always been.</p>

<section id="recognize" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Recognize</h2>

  <p class="etymology">
    <em>Latin</em> <strong>re</strong> (“again”) + <strong>cognoscere</strong> (“to know”)
    → <strong>recognitio</strong>: “knowing again”
  </p>

  <p>
    A return to knowing. Recognition does not create — it reveals.
    It is the quiet unveiling of what was never absent, only unnoticed.
    In this view, recognition is not a mental act but a felt remembrance —
    a reknowing of who and what we truly are.

    <!-- Conscious Awareness -->
<section id="conscious-awareness" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Conscious Awareness</h2>

  <p>
    Conscious Awareness refers to the non-dual reality in which all experience
    appears. It is not an object, a thing, or a personal faculty, but the
    ever-present knowingness by which all sensations, thoughts, and perceptions
    are known.
  </p>

  <p>
    Conscious Awareness is not located in the body or mind. Rather, the body,
    mind, and world appear within it. It is formless, indivisible, and unchanged
    by what arises.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we ordinarily take ourselves to be — a separate thinker or doer —
    is an appearance within Conscious Awareness. When this is recognized,
    identity shifts from form to presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Conscious Awareness does not come and go. It does not develop or transform.
    It is self-evident and remains the same, whether or not it is recognized.

   <!-- Soul -->
<section id="soul" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Soul</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Soul</strong> is a term used to describe the felt quality of life
    when experience is no longer filtered primarily through the small,
    self-referential sense of identity.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this context, Soul does not refer to a separate entity, layer, or inner
    guide. Rather, it names the natural intelligence, sensitivity, and
    compassion that are expressed when identification relaxes and life is
    lived in alignment with Conscious Awareness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soul is revealed not through effort or control, but through openness and
    attention. It is not something to be developed, but something that becomes
    evident as resistance softens.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this sense, Soul is not other than Awareness, but Awareness felt and
    expressed through human life.

    <!-- Aware -->
<section id="aware" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Aware</h2>

  <p>
    Awareness is not a brain function, nor does it belong to us personally.
    It is not something we possess — it is what we are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Awareness is self-knowing. It does not require an object, a process, or a witness
    in order to be present. Each apparent being is an expression of Conscious Awareness itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    In recognizing this, identification with the small self relaxes,
    and what remains is our True Self — not as an idea, but as immediate presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Awareness is not separate from what appears. Seeing, thinking, sensing,
    and acting arise within it, without dividing it. In this,
    the illusion of separation dissolves and the reality of non-duality becomes evident.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simply pausing and noticing that awareness is already present —
    without effort or reference — allows this recognition to reveal itself.

  <h2>Timeless</h2>

  <p>
    <em>“Time is the name we give the imaginary place that is ‘not now.’”<br>
    — Rupert Spira</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Timeless refers to the ever-present nature of Awareness, which is not
    divided into past, present, and future. Time, as it is ordinarily
    experienced, arises through memory and anticipation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The present moment is not a point on a timeline, but the unfragmented
    immediacy in which all experience appears. This immediacy is timeless.
  </p>

  <p>
    When identification with past and future relaxes, what remains is the
    simplicity and fullness of now — unchanged by duration or measure.

  <!-- Attribute -->
<section id="attribute" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Attribute</h2>

  <p>
    An attribute is an inherent quality, not something added from outside or
    acquired through effort. In non-dual understanding, qualities such as joy,
    peace, and freedom are not personal achievements, but natural expressions
    of Awareness itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attributes do not arise through becoming or improvement. They are recognized
    as already present when identification with a separate self relaxes.
