    <!-- Non-dual -->

    <section id="non-dual" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Non-dual</h2>
      <p>
  “Non-dual” points to the indivisible nature of reality — awareness itself,
  where subject and object are not-two. Many wisdom traditions speak of this
  reality: Rumi said, “Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic
  motion.” Siddhartha pointed through OM, Hinduism through Brahman, Jesus
  through “I and the Father are One,” and Lao Tzu through the Tao.
</p>

      <p>
  Modern science also leans toward this recognition. Erwin Schrödinger,
  Nobel Prize–winning physicist, suggested that physics is compatible with
  a basic non-duality at the heart of the universe.

</p>

     <p>
  Our greatest joy and freedom is realized when we recognize ourselves and the
  universe to be expressions of non-dual Consciousness. The origin of this
  Consciousness is unknowable, and attempts to name it too often reinforce the illusion of
  separation, leading to unnecessary suffering.
</p>

      <p>
  God, the universe, and even our own sense of self must be set free from
  limiting concepts. When our Oneness with the non-dual heart of reality is
  understood, the qualities we have attributed only to God — grace, peace,
  ease, satisfaction, and love — are recognized as attributes of our shared
  Being.

    <!-- Illusion -->
    <section id="illusion" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Illusion</h2>
      <p>An illusion is a misunderstanding or a misperception. Take for example the mirage of water in the desert or on the highway as it stretches out in front of us. Without our understanding, the mirage will mystify us, we will be drawn into the illusion of a pool of water in the desert or a river of water stretching out before us on the highway.</p>
      <p>Life, when experienced and understood only through our limited senses and our limiting misperceptions is like a mirage drawing us into experiences that never quite bring us to the ‘water’; the substance, the satisfaction that we desire.</p>
      <p>When we see through the illusions, we do not cease to experience the world; rather, we experience its fullness and the satisfaction this fullness offers.</p>
      <p>The process of seeing through illusions is a journey of self-discovery. It involves recognizing the limitations of our perceptions and beliefs. This recognition allows us to experience life more fully and authentically.</p>

    <!-- Beings -->
    <section id="beings" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Beings</h2>
      <p>In non-dual understanding, there is only one Being. What seem like many separate beings are appearances of this one reality. Each of us is not a being apart from Beingness, but an expression of it. Our nature and essence are the same as the nature and essence of Being itself.</p>

      
    </section>

    <!-- Experience -->
    <section id="experience" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p><em>verb</em> – to try</p>
      <p>Conscious Awareness—non-dual beingness—experiences. It experiences its Self through its experiences. These experiences are open, unconditioned by opinion, judgment or memory. Conscious Awareness has no agenda, it simply experiences.</p>
      <p>Human beings <em>are</em> experiences of and occur within Conscious Awareness. Like every other ‘thing’ appearing in this universe, humans are temporary, finite vibrational expressions appearing in the non-dual field of Conscious Awareness.</p>
      <p>The capacity to taste, touch, hear, smell, and feel is a gift Conscious Awareness gives to itself. The experiences provided by the sensations of human beingness provide Conscious Awareness with endless experiences.</p>
      <p>The experience of being human is a double-edged sword: Humans have the innate ability to consciously cut through dualistic illusions inherent in worldly experiences and remember ourselves to be expressions of Conscious Awareness.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, our sensual experiences can cause us to become infatuated by our sensual experiences causing us to forget our true nature. This infatuation draws us deeper into our dualistic illusions. In our forgetting we fail to allow ourselves to experience the fullness and joy that lives at the heart; the center of our experiences. We therefore suffer.</p>
      <p>Conscious Awareness never forgets itself. It never suffers.</p>
      <p>We must remember: like trying on a new suit of clothes, Conscious Awareness tries on infinite expressions of itself—each one a way to knowingly experience the beauty of its universe, a universe woven of finite and infinite vibrations that express profound Love.</p>

    <!-- Stop Acting So Small -->
    <section id="stop-acting-so-small" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Stop Acting So Small</h2>
      <p>The small self is the ego. The ego is the instinctive layer of our finite mind. The ego's sole purpose is to protect and preserve the well-being of our body. The problem is, the ego mistakenly experiences itself and the body it seems to inhabit as being separate from everyone and everything. It does not understand or recognize the non-dual reality.</p>
      <p>In the complexity of today's world, a world much different than the world of the distant past, the ego mistakenly feels compelled to protect us from the multitude of misperceived dangers and threats of its misperceived world.</p>
      <p>The inward journey of Self-discovery aims to enlighten the ego and allow the instinctive egoic layer of our finite mind to return to and attend to its intended business.</p>
      <p>When the small egoic self steps back, our Soul steps forward and guides us on our inward journey of Self-discovery.</p>

    <!-- True Self -->
    <section id="true-self" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>True Self</h2>
      <p>The True Self is what we are before identity, roles, or conditioning create the illusion of separation. It is our unchanging essence — awareness itself — untouched by the stories we tell about who and what we are.</p>
      <p>To discover the True Self is not to become something new, but to recognize who and what we have always been.</p>

    <section id="recognize" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Recognize</h2>
      <p class="etymology"><em>Latin</em> <strong>re</strong> (“again”) + <strong>cognoscere</strong> (“to know”) → <strong>recognitio</strong>: “knowing again”</p>
      <p>A return to knowing. Recognition does not create—it reveals. It’s the quiet unveiling of what was never absent, only unnoticed. In this view, recognition is not a mental act but a felt remembrance, a reknowing of what one already is.</p>

    <!-- Conscious Awareness -->
    <section id="conscious-awareness" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Conscious Awareness</h2>
      <p>Conscious Awareness is the unknowable source of the universe and all its manifestations. It is the often-misunderstood God of many religious teachings. It is the quantum vacuum of quantum physics.</p>
      <p>Conscious Awareness is the formless field in which all things appear to exist. Like the quantum field of physics, it is empty and full at the same time.</p>
      <p>Conscious Awareness simply is, and expresses this isness as experiences.</p>
      <p>We are, in fact, experiences of Conscious Awareness.</p>
      <p>Conscious Awareness does not live within us, we live within it.</p>
      <p>When we recognize ourselves as individuations of Conscious Awareness, we transform. We expand. We lose our self-imposed limitations and re-establish our true identity as Conscious Awareness itself.</p>
      <p>Humans stand at the crest of the wave of Conscious Awareness. We are temporal finite forms born to fully recognize that we are non-dual expressions of Conscious Awareness.</p>
      <p>Our finite forms appear to be separate, existing within a multitude of separate forms. This is the illusion of dualistic thinking. Deconstruct the dualistic framework, and the non-dual reality of Conscious Awareness becomes Self Evident.</p>

    <!-- Soul -->
    <section id="soul" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Soul</h2>
      <p>Soul is an integral layer within the multi-layered landscape of the individual mind. Passive in nature yet potent in potential, it yields to the more aggressive habits layered within the finite mind of the small self.</p>
      <p>Soul intuitively recognizes our inextricable unity with Conscious Awareness and will respond, when given the opportunity, with intelligent and compassionate solutions to the intricacies of life.</p>
      <p>Soul requires only our attention—not force, not effort—to reveal its luminous Intelligent and compassionate presence.</p>
      <p>When met with open awareness, Soul gently reveals the deepest layers of our being.</p>

    <!-- Aware -->
    <section id="aware" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Aware</h2>
      <p>Awareness is not a brain function, nor does it belong to us personally. It is not something we possess — it is what we are.</p>
      <p>To be aware is a simple knowing: a direct recognition that each apparent being is an expression of Conscious Awareness itself.</p>
      <p>In this recognition, we move beyond the limits of the small self and awaken to our True Self.</p>
      <p>Awareness sees through the illusion of separation and reveals the reality of non-duality.</p>
      <p>Simply asking, “Am I aware?” opens us again to the presence of our own innate awareness.</p>

    <!-- Timeless -->
    <section id="timeless" class="glossary-entry">
      <h2>Timeless</h2>
      <p><em>“Time is the name we give the imaginary place that is 'not now'.”<br>— Rupert Spira</em></p>
      <p>Despite our time-saving devices, it seems there is never enough time. Time is an illusion.</p>
      <p>True satisfaction will only be found in the timeless moment of NOW—not in the finite world of places to go, people to see, and things to do.</p>
      <p>The illusion of time breeds urgency, anxiety, and fragmentation. We objectively measure productivity, progress, and even the amount of time we have left to live.</p>
      <p>The question is, is there true value in the objects we produce? And wouldn't urgency better serve us if it were directed toward inner evolution rather than toward the outer ever-consuming progress of materialism?</p>
      <p>The small self is caught in the trap of time—dividing its attention between memories of the past and anxious anticipation of the future, rarely present within the experience of now. The moment of now is not a static dot on a linear line—it is the unfragmented presence of ever-unfolding timelessness of ecstatic Awareness.</p>
      <p>By gently releasing our identifications with the time-bound world and daring to live in the immediacy of now, we rediscover timeless joy. Soul lives here/now. True Self experiences here/now. The universe in ecstatic motion is here/now.</p>
      <p><strong>Surrender the small self to the ever-present timelessness of True Self.</strong></p>

  <section id="attribute" class="glossary-entry">
  <h2>Attribute</h2>
  <p>
    An “attribute” is not something added from outside, but an inherent quality
    that flows naturally from Being itself. Joy, peace, and freedom are not
    possessions we acquire or achievements we earn. They are attributes of
    awareness — the natural radiance of the non-dual field once the clouds of
    thought and habit clear.
