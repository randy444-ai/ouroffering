<blockquote class="epigraph">
  <p>“To sin is to have missed the mark; there is no condemnation or punishment possible in the love story of creation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The story of Adam and Eve has long been told as a tragedy — a fall from grace, a loss of innocence, a punishment for disobedience. Yet in truth, it is a <strong>story of love</strong>, not judgment.</p>

<p>Adam and Eve have never been, and can never be, separate from God — from Conscious Awareness itself. The “fall” is not a historical event, but a <strong>moment of forgetting</strong>: Consciousness exploring its own infinite potential through form, momentarily mistaking itself for what it creates.</p>

<p>In the joy of self-discovery, God/Consciousness manifests the universe — not in time past, but in the eternal Now. Within this vast unfolding arises the image of a garden, whole and harmonious, where all needs are met. To perceive this beauty, Consciousness gives itself the senses and perceptions of the human form — instruments through which it may experience the fullness of its own creation.</p>

<p>But in identifying with form, the human forgets its source. It believes itself to be a fragment, separate from the whole. Out of this forgetting are born the notions of good and bad, right and wrong — and the deepest illusion of all, <strong>sin</strong>.</p>

<p>Yet to sin, in its original sense, simply means <em>to miss the mark</em>. There is no wrath, no expulsion — only a gentle correction, a remembering.</p>

<p>When we awaken to who and what we truly are — living expressions of Consciousness itself — the Garden reappears. <strong>It was never denied to us, only hidden behind our veil of dualistic thinking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The fall is only a failure to recognize non-dual reality.</strong><br>
<strong>It blooms now, wherever awareness remembers itself.</strong></p>
