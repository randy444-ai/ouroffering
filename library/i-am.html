      <h1>The “I Am”</h1>

      <p>Awareness is not something we possess — Awareness possesses us. Awareness is who and what we are. It is the “I Am” that Jesus, and so many others, realized as the living truth.</p>

      <p>The “I Am” is pure, open, and without judgment. It holds no memory, no agenda. It cannot be closed or partial, for it is the very field in which all experience arises. This non-dual Awareness — the reality of what we are — is never absent. It is only obscured by the narrowing habit of mind.</p>

      <p>Our narrow-mindedness names and defines every appearance. In naming, we attach opinions; we separate this from that. And in this act of division, things seem to stand apart from the infinite wholeness of the “I Am.” This imagined “outside” — this belief in a world apart from Awareness — is the seed of all suffering.</p>

      <p>Our belief system obscures the truth. It teaches us to forget. But when we begin to recognize the flaws in that system, we see that the life we live is actively being shaped by our own misperception.</p>

      <p>When this realization dawns, a door opens. Freed from the boundaries of belief, we awaken to our innate creative Awareness. We discover that we are not merely participants in creation — we are its living expression.</p>

      <p>In allowing ourselves to rest as the “I Am,” we become aware expressions of the infinite unfolding love and beauty of Consciousness itself. Here, creation flows effortlessly. Here, every breath, every thought, every gesture becomes an offering of the “I Am” to itself — Awareness knowing its own endless beauty.</p>
