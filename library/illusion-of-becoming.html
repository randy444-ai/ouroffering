      <p>
        When we identify ourselves as separate from the whole, it naturally follows
        that we feel compelled to become full. We feel obligated to become something, and so
        we spend our days pursuing becoming—measuring, striving and defending an imagined,
        imperfect world and self.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the perspective of non-dual understanding, there is nothing to become.  
        There is nothing to improve.<br />
        That which is All cannot become more than it already is.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fear, anger, anxiety, violence, and suffering occurring in the world arise from this
        single misperception: the belief that we are incomplete and must work to become whole. The symptoms of this misperception are
        many, but the remedy is singular. It has been offered again and again by those who have
        recognized our inherent non-dual nature. What obscures this recognition is our
        persistent attachment to the illusion of separation.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not need to look far for a remedy. The timeless words of Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, and
        Rumi point to it clearly. In our own time, teachers such as Jean Klein, Rupert Spira, and Eckhart
        Tolle continue to draw from the same well, offering the same medicine in contemporary language.
      </p>

      <p>
        The endless and impossible quest to become comes at a cost. Our misperceptions are eroding the very environment
        from which we draw our daily bread. There will never be enough achieving, possessing, or
        becoming to fill the illusion of needing to become.
      </p>

      <p><strong>
        We are now—have always been, and will always be—whole.<br />
        When this is recognized, our true needs are met.
