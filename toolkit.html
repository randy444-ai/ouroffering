  <!-- Self-Observation -->

    <div class="entry-body">
      <p>
        Self-observation is an essential tool we can use in our efforts to open ourselves
        to our natural, ever-present state of happiness, peace and freedom.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we use Self-observation, we simply, without judgment, watch ourselves as we
        go about our day. We pay attention to the way we unconsciously react to the events
        of the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we use self-observation, we will see that we unconsciously allow ourselves
        to act small. Our small actions are habitual; they are the cause of our suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our habits; the unknowing way we respond to our day to day, moment by moment
        experiences have been fed to us by our families and culture. These habitual ways
        of seeing and reacting to life do not include the understanding that we live
        within a non-dual universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can, as the observer, quietly and without judgment, watch ourselves and the
        world around us. We can watch the way our small thoughts cause our suffering.
        Practiced in this way, nonjudgmental self-observation becomes a nutrient-dense
        feast for the Soul, and as we feed our Soul, our Soul, in turn, feeds us
        happiness, peace and freedom.

  <!-- Self-Remembering -->
  <section id="self-remembering" class="tool-entry">

      <h2>Self-Remembering</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-body">
      <p>
        Self-remembering is a tool useful in our efforts to become aware of our
        true Self—the Self that is the potent eternal expression of Consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Self-remembering is the act of recognizing that we are the ecstatic universe in motion. It is the act of
        opening ourselves to the reality that our nature and the integral nature of the universe are one and the same:
        indescribable, yet eternally present. It is the process of remembering that we are, and all things are, a singular
        yet multifaceted expression of the jewel of Consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Self-remembering involves remembering that Soul exists within each of us and is always available to
        introduce us to our true Self. It is the art of remembering that we are, at all times and regardless of appearances,
        our true Self—the expression of eternal Consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever we have the presence of mind, we should pause and acknowledge that there is a true Self.
        Even if we do not yet fully understand its depth, the simple act of reflecting upon it penetrates and dissolves
        our misperceptions about who and what we think we are. In these moments, we rediscover ourselves as eternal Consciousness.

  <!-- Self-Observation / Self-Remembering -->
  <section id="self-observation-remembering" class="tool-entry">

    <div class="entry-header">
      <h2>Self-Observation / Self-Remembering</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-body">
      <p>
        The process of self-remembering can go hand in hand with self-observation. At the moment we remember to
        self-observe, there is an opportunity to simultaneously, with split attention, self-remember.
        We can watch our small self—acting small—while remembering that our true Self is as vast and eternal as
        Rumi’s “universe in ecstatic motion.”
      </p>

      <p>
        In these moments of split attention, we are both the observed and the observer. Time slows, and insight
        into what it means to be the universe in ecstatic motion filters into awareness. In these effortless moments,
        true Mind, Body, and Spirit align. We nourish the Soul and open ourselves to a taste of the ultimate reality—
        where, as Rumi reminds us, we will find the field where, “When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about.”

  <!-- STOP -->
  <section id="stop" class="tool-entry">
    <div class="entry-header">
      <h2>STOP</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-body">
      <p>
        When we find ourselves caught in the time-driven, anxious world of our small self,
        we can ask ourself to STOP and remember. In that moment of STOP, we can take a breath.
        The act of taking a breath at the moment of the STOP brings us into the ever-present
        awareness of now. Now is the magical moment where we can allow ourselves to remember
        who and what we truly are. Every moment we cause ourselves to Self-remember has the
        effect of transforming the moment into a conscious, timeless, anxiety-free experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our moments of Self-remembering, we consciously allow the vibrant energy of reality
        to mix with the dense energy of the material world. The resulting transformed energy is
        the nourishing energy we give to our Soul.
      </p>

      <p>The true Self will respond to this energetic gift.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full—pressed down, shaken
        together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you
        give will determine the amount you get back.”
        <br />—Luke 6:38
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We can accept the responsibility of giving ourselves to the timeless moment of now. We
        can, in the moment of now, remember that we are expressions of eternal Consciousness.
        And we can express gratitude; we can thank the moment of now for the opportunity to
        awaken to our ever-present true Self.
