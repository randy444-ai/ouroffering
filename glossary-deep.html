<section id="conflict">
  <h2>Conflict</h2>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> Conflict arises only within the illusion of individuality. In our real nature—which is oneness—no conflict is possible.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> When we observe the mind while Self-remembering, habitual patterns dissolve. Aggression and competition lose their grip, and the quiet of Being is restored.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Ask yourself just how enslaved you are to your opinions and habits which are the source of perpetual conflict. Observe how your mind works, look at how it functions, look without preconceived ideas.”<br>— Jean Klein, <em>I AM</em></p>

<section id="aim">
  <h2>Aim</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“There is no aim. God is perfection and beyond improvement. If we want to talk in terms of an aim, the world and objects are there only to reveal the ultimate subject, ‘I AM.’”<br>— Jean Klein</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The “I AM” that Klein speaks of is beyond space and time. It is empty of thought, memory, and identity. In the open, timeless emptiness of unfiltered awareness, the True Self is recognized.</p>
  <p>The God Klein speaks of is Consciousness. Any thought that perceives God as separate from non-dual reality is illusion. Any prayer offered to a separate God is likened to worshiping the golden idol Moses warned of. Prayers born in misunderstanding our non-dual reality—and our inclusion as being One with God—carry us away from our True Self.</p>
  <p><strong>Meditate. Measure. Recognize:</strong> we are the I AM.</p>
