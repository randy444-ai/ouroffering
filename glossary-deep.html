<section id="conflict">
  <h2>Conflict</h2>
  <p>Conflict is a projection that originates from within the misunderstandings of the small, egoic self. Our true Self understands that there is no need for conflict.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We must ask ourselves just how enslaved we are to our opinions and habits.  Our habits and opinions are the source of perpetual conflict. "Observe how your mind works, look at how it functions, look without preconceived ideas.”<br>— Jean Klein, <em>I AM</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When we acknowledge oneness—hold it in the stillness of our awareness—it is possible to see that, as the illusion of being an individual, we are nothing more than a revolving door of habitual thinking. We build walls of opinions around ourselves and imprison ourselves within our unconsciously created walls. We act out the role of a competitor and practice aggression. This competition and aggression, regardless of its intention, carries us away from our true Self.</p>
  <p>The act of <a href="toolkit.html#self-observation">self observation</a>, when carried out while <a href="toolkit.html#self-remembering">Self remembering</a>—remembering our <a href="glossary.html#nonduality">oneness</a>—dissolves the illusion of separation and frees us from unnecessary internal and external conflict born in our mistaken egoic opinions.</p>
</section>

<section id="aim">
  <h2>Aim</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“There is no aim. God is perfection and beyond improvement. If we want to talk in terms of an aim, the world and objects are there only to reveal the ultimate subject, ‘I AM.’”<br>— Jean Klein</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The “I AM” that Klein speaks of is beyond space and time. It is empty of thought, memory, and identity. In the open, timeless emptiness of unfiltered awareness, the True Self is recognized.</p>
  <p>The God Klein speaks of is Conscious Awareness. Any thought that perceives God as being separate from us is illusion. Any prayer offered to a separate God is likened to worshiping the golden idol Moses warned of. Prayers born in the idea that we are separate from God and that we need to petition some being outside ourselves for mercey or guidance carries us away from our true identitiy as expressions of Conscious Awareness itself.</p>
  <p><strong>Meditate. Measure. Recognize:</strong> we are the I AM.</p>
