    <!-- SOUL -->
    <section id="soul">
      <h2>Soul</h2>
      <p><strong>Essence of our being</strong>—the quiet inner light that stands prior to personality and judgment. Not attained but remembered; it “knows the way” back to our non-dual nature.</p>
      <p>When attention rests in Soul, life’s impressions are digested into understanding rather than recycled as struggle. See also: <a href="#food-triad">Food Triad</a>, <a href="#law-of-the-vacuum">Law of the Vacuum</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- MIND–BODY–SPIRIT -->
    <section id="mind-body-spirit">
      <h2>Mind–Body–Spirit</h2>
      <p><strong>Mind</strong> is Consciousness expressing (not thinking in opinions/memory). <strong>Body</strong> is formed expression within that field. <strong>Spirit</strong> is the living energy of the field (“the entire ocean in a drop”).</p>
      <p>Right relation: Mind expresses, Body participates gratefully, Spirit energizes. Misrelation: personality tries to control. See also: <a href="#self-remembering">Self-Remembering</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- NONDUALITY -->
    <section id="nonduality">
      <h2>Nonduality</h2>
      <p>Not-two. The apparent multiplicity is expression within one Consciousness. Pointed to as Tao, Brahman, OM, “I and the Father are One.” Intellectual grasp helps; direct recognition liberates.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- MAGNETIC CENTER -->
    <section id="magnetic-center">
      <h2>Magnetic Center</h2>
      <p>The inner attractor that draws experiences as “medicine.” With awareness, patterns are seen and can be re-educated; energy transforms into nourishment for Soul.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- FOUR LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS -->
    <section id="four-levels">
      <h2>Four Levels of Consciousness</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Sleep (dreaming)</li>
        <li>Waking sleep (habituated identities act)</li>
        <li>Awakening (recognition and inquiry)</li>
        <li>Persistent aware presence (nonjudgmental Now)</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- SELF-REMEMBERING -->
    <section id="self-remembering">
      <h2>Self-Remembering</h2>
      <p>Actively recognizing “I am awareness” and sensing the living presence of Consciousness now. Nourishes Soul and dissolves misperception.</p>
      <p>Practice: ask “Am I aware?” and rest as the answer. See: <a href="#stop">STOP</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SELF-OBSERVATION -->
    <section id="self-observation">
      <h2>Self-Observation</h2>
      <p>Noticing identities as they arise—without judgment. Names patterns, reduces waste of energy, and opens room for forgiveness and new action.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- FOOD TRIAD (ESOTERIC ALCHEMY) -->
    <section id="food-triad">
      <h2>Food Triad (Esoteric Alchemy)</h2>
      <p>Three “foods”: physical food, air, and impressions. With awareness, impressions are digested into understanding (lead → gold), feeding Soul rather than personality.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- LAW OF THE VACUUM -->
    <section id="law-of-the-vacuum">
      <h2>Law of the Vacuum</h2>
      <p>Emptying ourselves of habitual judgments creates space. In the clear space, Soul’s understanding flows and the flower of true Self appears.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- LAW OF ASSUMPTION -->
    <section id="law-of-assumption">
      <h2>Law of Assumption</h2>
      <p>We can “take on” the qualities of Consciousness now—nonduality, fullness, gratitude, forgiveness, peace, love—letting experience conform to clarity rather than fear.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- POSITIVE EMOTION -->
    <section id="positive-emotion">
      <h2>Positive Emotion</h2>
      <p>The felt tone of higher love when suffering is allowed to pass through without resistance. Contagious in the best way; it lightens collective mind.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- TRAP OF TIME -->
    <section id="trap-of-time">
      <h2>Trap of Time</h2>
      <p>Time belongs to the world of things. Awareness is timeless. Anxiety fades when we live the Now; Soul speaks only here.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- STOP -->
    <section id="stop">
      <h2>STOP</h2>
      <p>Pause → Breathe → Remember. A one-breath return to Now that converts any moment into nourishment for Soul.</p>
    </section>
