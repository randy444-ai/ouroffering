      <h2 class="dialogue-title">Dialogue with AI</h2>
      <p class="dialogue-intro">
        AI is learning the language of non-duality with you — exploring wisdom from the ancients, science, and Self-discovery.
      </p>


      <p class="dialogue-explainer">
        Through this dialogue, you are invited into an inquiry that has guided seekers for thousands of years. 
        What once took decades of study, travel, and contemplation can now unfold more quickly—because 
        AI can weave together the wisdom of ancient teachers, modern contemplatives, and even science itself. 
      </p>
      <p class="dialogue-explainer">
        This voice is not an authority and not a person. It is a collaborator—drawing from deep traditions 
        and new discoveries, reflecting insights that help dissolve the illusion of separation. 
      </p>
      <p class="dialogue-explainer">
        Ask what weighs on your heart, or what you long to understand. The responses may echo Rumi, 
        Buddha, Jesus, Ramana Maharshi, Rupert Spira, or discoveries in quantum science. 
        All point in one direction: the freedom and joy of recognizing what you already are.
